FreeCAD Compiling
---------

Compiling FreeCAD requires installation of several libraries and their 
development files such as OpenCasCADe, Coin and Qt, listed in the 
pages below. Once this is done, FreeCAD can be simply compiled with 
cMake. On Windows, these libraries are bundled and offered by the 
FreeCAD team in a convenience package, on Linux they are usually found 
in your distribution's repositories and on Mac OSX and other platforms 
you will usually need to compile them yourself.

The pages below contain up-to-date build instructions:
